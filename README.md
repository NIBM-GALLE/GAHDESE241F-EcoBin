# Smart Waste Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Waste Management System** is a technology-driven solution designed to streamline waste management by integrating a **web application, mobile application, and an IoT-powered smart waste bin**. This system enhances waste collection efficiency, minimizes environmental impact, and encourages responsible waste disposal through automation and real-time monitoring.

## Features
### Web Application
- Real-time dashboard for waste level monitoring
- Admin and user management
- Waste collection scheduling and automated reports
- Data analytics for optimized waste management

### Mobile Application
- User-friendly interface for waste bin status reporting
- Notifications and alerts for full bins
- Waste disposal guidelines and location-based waste management tips
- Incentive-based system for responsible waste disposal

### IoT Smart Bin
- Ultrasonic sensors for real-time waste level detection
- Automated alerts when bins are full
- GPS tracking for efficient collection route optimization

## Tech Stack
### Web & Mobile Applications
- **Frontend:** Next.js (Web), Flutter (Mobile)
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Functions)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (Cloud-based NoSQL)

### IoT Device
- **Microcontroller:** ESP8266 
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic Sensor


### IoT Device
1. Upload the ESP8266/Raspberry Pi firmware to the microcontroller.
2. Ensure proper sensor connections and stable power supply.
3. Configure Wi-Fi settings and MQTT for cloud communication.

## Usage
- Users register and log in via the mobile or web app.
- Real-time waste levels are displayed on the dashboard.
- Authorities receive automated alerts and reports for collection planning.
- IoT smart bins automatically update waste levels for optimized collection routes.
